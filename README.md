# MatchUp - Events Management Assistant for Sports
### An app that helps users find people in their local area who want to play the same sport, connect and meet to play. A project I built for my undergrad dissertation project in 2018.

## Project Description
Technology and exercise are two topics of which in the past could not sound more further apart. However, as technology evolves, more innovative and creative forms of use are being explored to provide a new world of possibilities. Could the use of mobile phone technology be successfully utilised to create a platform that promotes social interaction and exercise? This report outlines the steps taken through the development of an android application with the intention to improve the method in which people meet and plan for sports-based events. Starting with thorough research into related topics ranging from efficient and effective graphical user interfaces to the statistics of technology use today. What was discovered is transformed into a tactical and inventive solution. Ideas are analysed and debated until an appropriate system is decided and designed. The implementation is then developed and tested to assign value to the success. MatchUp allows for people of any ability to join a community of like minded peers to support each other in developing their skills. This is possible due to several user-friendly features backed up by research including an instantaneous live chat, revised social matching method and easy event creation.

## Project Objectives
1. Allow users to find people to play a given sport with. The output of this objective would be that each user has their own personalised profile that will display which sports grounds they are closest to, what sports they enjoy, as well as other details about the user.
2. Implement a social matching algorithm. The output of this objective would be that the app will match users based on the sport they want to play, how close they are from each other, as well as several other factors determined by the user’s profiles.
3. Plan a sport event. The desired output for this objective would be that the application will allow users to communicate with a basic messaging platform so that they are able to plan a time and place to meet. As well as this, the objective will also produce the output is that the app will sync to the user’s calendar on their phone (with user permission) as a reminder of the event.
4. Find users in the local area. The output of this objective would be that the app will use locational services to place the user and find other users close to them. However, this will not give away any personal details of any users (e.g. address).
5. Improve the users playing experience. Matching users based on their ability which will be provided by the user when creating their profile would achieve this objective.
6. Inform the user of currently occurring sports based events in their local area. The output would be a feature within the app that displays all events within a set radius of the user’s location. This feature would list all current events that are going to happen within the upcoming week with information such as when, where, and how to join.
7. Inform the user of when someone would like to connect with them. The output would be to allow push notifications on the user’s device.

## Project Background
When considering the development of a sports-based event management app, I researched the current market and assessed the need for such a system. The existing apps primarily focused on allowing sports clubs and teams to organize their activities.

For instance, Teamer is a mobile and web application that enables existing teams to communicate and schedule their matches. It also has features that allow members to donate to the sports club and view updates and images on the team's profile [1]. However, my app's focus is to allow individual users to find others to play with.

Another example is ActiveNetwork, which helps established teams to network, communicate, and recruit new members. This network emphasizes the administrative aspect of event management and includes features such as financial management, merchandising, and team stats analysis [2]. While I could use Active Network as a reference point, my app intends to offer a social feature that enables users to find other players in their local area and connect with them to schedule their games.

I also explored the top general event management apps and compared them using [3]. The apps I considered were:
- Eventbrite - This app provides information on the ongoing events in the user's locality and allows them to filter results based on distance. It also includes details on when and where the events are happening and has a feature that enables users to buy tickets. This feature could be useful in displaying ongoing events.
- Snafflz - This app is more focused on the social aspect of events. Users can check into events, leave reviews, and make recommendations. A similar feature could be included in my app, allowing users to review each other.
- Bizzabo - This app has excellent reviews on its user interface, which is minimalistic, leaving little room for confusion. Considering the user interface is an essential aspect of app development, this app's design can serve as a reference point.

After considering all these factors, I realized that there are limited applications like the one I intend to develop.

## Project Requirements
### Must have
- Social Matching Algorithm- Allowing users to find others on the app to play a desired sport with
- Communication- There will be an inbuilt messaging system which will allow users to contact each other. This will also make use of push notifications on the user’s device. 
- Database- A database containing information on any area or centre that offers the facilities to allow users to play a sport including their location, facilities, amenities and availability will be linked to the app.
- Event creation- The app will allow the users to plan the event and it will be shown in their calendars and they will be reminded of the event.

### Desirable
- User Rating- Each user can be rated after the event has been played to allow them to build up their profile and find more appropriate matched for them specifically in the future.
- User friendly- The user interface of the application will be easy to navigate and will be usable by people of all abilities.
- Individual profiles- Each user has a profile they can personalise so that the sorting algorithm can use their details to find them matches to play with.

### Aspirational
- Fitness Tracker feature- if there is enough time within the project timeline, it may be useful to include a fitness tracker, in theme with the app so that the user can view and track their progress within the app.
- Image sharing- The profiles could have a space to share photos of the user playing sports so that it is easier for other users to identify them.

## Ethical & Legal Implications
One ethical issue posed by the proposal of this project is that the final product could easily be used in place of a dating app such as Tinder or Plenty of Fish. Though this issue cannot be completely avoided, it can be restricted by limiting the amount of personal information displayed on a user profiles as well as having a report and/or block user feature available within the app.

As well as this, to avoid certain ethical issues, dummy data will be used instead of real user data when testing so that no test users are at risk in terms of data protection. As well as this, an evaluation plan will be implemented after testing. This will specify the methods of evaluation of the product, for example:
- A group of users who differ in ability will use the product for a set amount of time to complete certain activities, and then fill out a questioner giving feedback on their experience.
- Self-evaluation will be completed where the creator will go through and assess the app compared to the initial requirements and state how it has met or fallen short of the specification.

In terms of social issues, the project will be developed considering users of all different abilities so that the product can be accessible and understandable by all users so that no one is limited. The application will be adjustable within phone setting so that features such as brightness and text size can be altered to be comfortable for users with any visual impairment.

The project will abide by the Data protection act (1998) to ensure personal data is protected and only shared rightfully. As well as all other laws and acts in relation to data and technology so that the product is made within the requirements of the law and causes no issues.
